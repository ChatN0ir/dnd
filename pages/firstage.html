        <h2>The First Age: </h2>
            <p><strong>First</strong> came the <strong>Age of Gods</strong>. There were not one, but many, and they rarely
                got along well. Creating the world, and all living things upon it, the Gods promptly went to war, and were
                mostly killed in battle. Their remains scattered throughout the land, and as they decayed, imbued the
                lands with magic, and wonder.</p>
