        <h2>The Fourth Age: </h2>
            <p>Thus began the <strong>Fourth Age</strong>. The <strong>Age of
                Life</strong>. With the great portals of magic closed, and much of civilization destroyed, the races began to
                rebuild their towns and cities into a more functional, practical land. Hundreds of small villages and
                hamlets now provide food, textiles, and raw materials to the larger cities that have rebuilt themselves
                over the eons on Inis Skayle. The Capital city, <strong>Cathair Mor Gardenought (The City of Gardens)</strong> was built
                just outside the gates of the <strong>Great Crossing</strong>, where it is supposed the first <strong>Ogham Shrine</strong> was placed. Here
                both the gates and the Shrine are heavily protected and monitored by the King's Guard. Travel to and from the
                Westernlands is open, but heavily monitored, and while the trip is open to any honest creature, only
                daring traders, and others who stand to gain dare to cross it.</p>
