        <h2>The Third Age: </h2>
            <p>And thus began <strong>The Third Age</strong>, the <strong>Age of Monsters</strong>. Whether the
                peoples that ruled Inis Skayle became greedy with their knowledge and wealth is unknown. Perhaps the
                Gods became jealous of their power? Perhaps a zealous wizard pierced the veil to another plane? The
                Monsters came nonetheless.</p>
            
            <p>Ghouls, Goblins, Demons and Devils, Dragons, and greater horrors came in
                their hordes. Elementals rocked the land, bringing fire, flood, and famine. An alliance of creatures fought
                back the hordes, slayed the dragons, and made peace with the elementals.</p>
                
            <p>Led by the <strong>Great King Eoghan</strong>,
                a great guild of warriors, druids, paladins, clerics, warlocks, and wizards used the best magical skills they
                possessed to create four elemental stones of balance, and placed them within the first <strong>Ogham Shrine</strong> ever built
                by the first peoples to inhabit Inis Skayle. Copies of the stones were made and placed within every
                <strong>Ogham Shrine</strong>, so that no one would be able to tip the balance of Nature's wrath again. The Shrines were
                closed, along with the magical portals they provided.</p>
