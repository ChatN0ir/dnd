        <h2>The Second Age: </h2>
        <p>Thus came the <strong>Second Age</strong>. The <strong>Age of Magic</strong>. This age brought forth
            great discovery and learning.</p>
            
        <p>Entire civilizations were built and razed during this time. Discovery and
            mastery of the Arcane, and the innate magic of nature were harnessed to do the bidding of its' holders.
            Men, Elves, Dwarves, Halfling, Gnomes, and a great many other creatures unknown came into their
            renaissance in this Age.</p>
            
        <p>The Great <strong>Wizard Harptos</strong> conquered the mysteries of time, and recorded the
            seasons, and the months. However, it is unknown who build the Great Crossing. Perhaps it was the gods,
            perhaps Harptos, perhaps a confluence of magical creatures working in great harmony. Nonetheless, the
            <strong>Great Crossing</strong> was built, along with the <strong>Ogham Shrines</strong>. The great kings of past gathered in peace at these
            stones, and it is rumored that during the Age of Magic, one could pass through a stone, and come out
            another in the blink of an eye, hundreds of miles away. It was at this pinnacle of peace, prosperity, and
            advancement, that the monsters began to come.</p>
