        <h2>Opening</h2>
        <p>
            Our Stories Begins in the Small town of <strong>Bollan Orsa</strong>. Perhaps one of the oldest settlements in Inis Skayle, 
            it is often the most overlooked, situated in the southernmost section of the island settled along the coast of a large inlet, 
            often used for fishing. The great events of the year mostly involve the comings and goings of tradesmen, 
            and half truths of information about the realm at large. The capital city of Inis Skayle, lies in the NorthWestern Corner of the island, 
            hundreds of miles away, and the news of the world only trickles in drips and drops to this small little piece of the world. 
            Livestock, including Yaks, Sheep, and Camels carry wool, cheese, and fish from this coastal town to nearby towns and villages. 
            The women of <strong>Bollan Orsa</strong> are renowned for their Woolen garments, providing even the northernmost folk of the Skayle warmth in harsh times. 
            The rustic square of the village includes a Tavern Inn call the Barrel's Bottom, a Smithy, a shop, a small wizards guild, 
            and numerous other places of business. The town is led by a small group of town elders, who vote on decisions for the greater good of <strong>Bollan Orsa</strong>>. 
            These recorded minutes and small pieces of legislature eventually make their way to Anoch, the center of the similarly named Kingdom. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Four kingdoms on this Island exist in relation to their elemental counterpart; Anoch (The Southwest and wettest kingdom) worshipers of the water elementals, Farehalla (Southeast to Middle East) who worship the Air elementals, An Amshear (The Northeast part of the island), who worship the Earth Elementals, and Lastly Bolcan Ulach (The northwest kingdown), who worship the Fire Elementals
        </p>
        <P>These four kingdoms answer to the king, and lord of the realm King Killean. Ruling these last 30 years, the realm has reamed safe, and without major conflict, of which the four kingdoms were previously riddled with.

            It seems Inis Skayle has settled into the Fourth Age Quite nicely...or so it seems….  
        </p>
        <p>As you all walk through the wooden archways of the small village, you immediately see the town square, a large area layn with rough cobblestone. Small shops and homes surround this square. A smithy sits to your right, a thin black vein of smoke making its way out of the chimney. A tavern lies across the way, with a sign hanging above the door that reads “The Barrell’s Bottom.” The air smells of cooking meats, livestock, hay, with a slight tinge of ocean spray. You hear a few shopkeepers chatting in the courtyard about current fish prices, and a few children are gathered around a plump lady rolling a  cheese cart across the courtyard. It feels like any other town. Innocent, unassuming, and teeming with potential adventure. <strong>You hear a man...</strong></p>
