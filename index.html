        <h1><strong>The Trails of Inis Skayle - A homebrewed world setting for Dnd - 5e</strong></h1> 
        <p>Hello! and welcome to the wonderful world of my fucked up brain and bad writing! I hope you enjoy the content I have to share. Campaign Materials are available in many of these ages!</p>
        
        <h2>The history of the Skayle</h2>
            <p>The world here is old. <em>Very old</em>. And Inis Skayle is as old as they come. Translated from the elder
                language to The Island of Scales, it is easy to see this place has seen things in the past. Inis Skayle now
                lives within the Fourth Age.</p>

        <h2>Present Day:</h2>
            <p>Life is more or less simple amongst the peoples of Inis Skayle, and crimes of murder and warfare are now
                few and far between. For the last 30 years, <strong>King Killean</strong> has ruled justly over the lands comprised of the
                many clans, and creatures. Here the kingship is decided amongst the leaders of the most prominent clans,
                and cities, so that Bloodlines may only continue their reign if they are deemed just. Recently, however, a
                series of thefts have been unsettled many of the smaller town and villages, particularly towns containing
                the Ogham stones. In a frightening fashion, the people of the towns have woken to find many of their
                possessions missing, and their stone smashed. Without recent acknowledgment from the King, a small
                village in the southernmost part of the Skayle have sent out a For Hire Flier for their most recent robbery,
                and a hefty reward for those who may be able to catch these bandits, and return their belongings. <strong><em>It is here
                we begin the story...</em></strong></p>
