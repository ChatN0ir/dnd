        <h1><strong>The Trails of Inis Skayle - A homebrewed world setting for Dnd - 5e</strong></h1> 
        <h2>The history of the Skayle</h2>
            <p>The world here is old. <em>Very old</em>. And Inis Skayle is as old as they come. Translated from the elder
                language to The Island of Scales, it is easy to see this place has seen things in the past. Inis Skayle now
                lives within the Fourth Age.</p>
        <h2>The First Age: </h2>
            <p><strong>First</strong> came the <strong>Age of Gods</strong>. There were not one, but many, and they rarely
                got along well. Creating the world, and all living things upon it, the Gods promptly went to war, and were
                mostly killed in battle. Their remains scattered throughout the land, and as they decayed, imbued the
                lands with magic, and wonder.</p>
        <h2>The Second Age: </h2>
            <p>Thus came the <strong>Second Age</strong>. The <strong>Age of Magic</strong>. This age brought forth
                great discovery and learning. Entire civilizations were built and razed during this time. Discovery and
                mastery of the Arcane, and the innate magic of nature were harnessed to do the bidding of its' holders.
                Men, Elves, Dwarves, Halfling, Gnomes, and a great many other creatures unknown came into their
                renaissance in this Age. The Great Wizard Harptos conquered the mysteries of time, and recorded the
                seasons, and the months. However, it is unknown who build the Great Crossing. Perhaps it was the gods,
                perhaps Harptos, perhaps a confluence of magical creatures working in great harmony. Nonetheless, the
                Great Crossing was built, along with the Ogham Stones. The great kings of past gathered in peace at these
                stones, and it is rumored that during the Age of Magic, one could pass through a stone, and come out
                another in the blink of an eye, hundreds of miles away. It was at this pinnacle of peace, prosperity, and
                advancement, that the monsters began to come.</p>
        <h2>The Third Age: </h2>
            <p>And thus began <strong>The Third Age</strong>, the <strong>Age of Monsters</strong>. Whether the
                peoples that ruled Inis Skayle became greedy with their knowledge and wealth is unknown. Perhaps the
                Gods became jealous of their power, perhaps a zealous wizard pierced the veil to another plane, but the
                Monsters came nonetheless. Ghouls, Goblins, Demons and Devils, Dragons, and greater horrors came in
                their hordes. Elementals rocked the land, bring fire, flood, and famine. An alliance of creatures fought
                back the hordes, slayed the dragons, and made peace with the elementals. Led by the Great King Eoghan,
                a great guild of warriors, druids, paladins, clerics, warlocks, and wizards used the best magical skills they
                possessed to create four elemental stones of balance, and placed them within the Ogham stone ever built,
                by the first peoples to inhabit Inis Skayle. Copies of the stones were made and placed within every
                Ogham stone, so that no one would be able to tip the balance of Nature's wrath again. The stones were
                closed, along with the magical portals they provided.</p>
        <h2>The Fourth Age: </h2>
            <p>Thus began the <strong>Fourth Age</strong>. The <strong>Age of
                Life</strong>. With the great portals of magic closed, and much of civilization destroyed, the races began to
                rebuild their towns, and cities into a more functional, practical land. Hundreds of small villages and
                hamlets now provides food, textiles, and raw materials to the larger cities that have rebuilt themselves
                over the eons on Inis Skayle. The capital city, Cathair Mor Gardenought (The City of Gardens) was built
                just outside the gates of the Great Crossing, where it is supposed the first Ogham Stone was placed. Here
                both the gates and the Stone are heavily protected and monitored by the King's Guard. Travel to/from the
                Westernlands is open, but heavily monitored, and while the trip is open to any honest creature, only
                daring traders, and others who stand to gain dare to cross it.</p>

        <h2>Present Day:</h2>
            <p>Life is more or less simple amongst the peoples of Inis Skayle, and crimes of murder and warfare are now
                few and far between. For the last 30 years, <strong>King Killean</strong> has ruled justly over the lands comprised of the
                many clans, and creatures. Here the kingship is decided amongst the leaders of the most prominent clans,
                and cities, so that Bloodlines may only continue their reign if they are deemed just. Recently, however, a
                series of thefts have been unsettled many of the smaller town and villages, particularly towns containing
                the Ogham stones. In a frightening fashion, the people of the towns have woken to find many of their
                possessions missing, and their stone smashed. Without recent acknowledgment from the King, a small
                village in the southernmost part of the Skayle have sent out a For Hire Flier for their most recent robbery,
                and a hefty reward for those who may be able to catch these bandits, and return their belongings. <strong><em>It is here
                we begin the story...</em></strong></p>
